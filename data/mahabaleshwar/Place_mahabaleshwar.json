The point offers a unique geological feature often referred to as a \"Window Point\" as it gives a clear view of the deep valley without any obstruction.

It is named after Sir Arthur Malet, who was the first to build a house here and is said to have regularly visited the point. Legend has it that he would sit here and gaze upon the Savitri Valley, as it was from here that he threw the bodies of his wife and children into the river during a tragic accident, possibly after a boat capsize. This poignant story adds a melancholic layer to the otherwise beautiful and serene landscape, making the viewpoint not just a place of natural beauty but also a site of a personal tragedy.",

Its existence is due to the geological formation of the Sahyadri mountains and the monsoon rains. While there isn't a specific historical event or person tied to its origin, its allure has made it a significant natural landmark for centuries. Local folklore might associate it with various deities or nature spirits, but scientifically, its story is one of continuous erosion and the powerful force of water shaping the landscape over geological time.",
