The story links it to the saptarishis (seven great sages) who were said to have performed intense penance on the banks of the holy Ganga. Later, Swami Vishudhanand Ji, a 19th-century saint famously known as Kali Kamli Wala, chose this site to spread spiritual teachings and serve pilgrims and sadhus. The ashram was built in his memory and became a sanctuary for seekers of enlightenment. Even today, the serene environment, spiritual vibrations, and daily rituals like the Ganga Aarti remind visitors of those mythological times when the gods themselves were believed to descend to listen to the prayers echoing through the valley.",

Littering, use of plastic, smoking, and open fires are banned to prevent harm to the forest. Wearing dull-colored clothes and avoiding strong perfumes is advised. Flash photography is not allowed, and any kind of hunting equipment, sharp objects, or harmful items are forbidden. These rules help keep the park safe and peaceful for both visitors and animals.",
      "story": "Rajaji National Park, nestled in the Shivalik ranges near Haridwar and Rishikesh, is not only a haven for rich biodiversity but also holds deep cultural and spiritual significance, as its forests have long been considered sacred Tapovans where ancient sages meditated and legends say Lord Shiva himself wandered. The park, named after C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji), India’s first Indian Governor-General, was established in 1983 by merging three sanctuaries—Rajaji, Motichur, and Chilla—and is home to elephants, tigers, leopards, and hundreds of bird species. With its blend of mythological reverence and ecological richness, the park offers a unique harmony of spirituality, wildlife, and natural beauty, deeply rooted in India’s cultural and environmental heritage.",

Dress modestly and respectfully, as most places are active temples or sacred ghats. Attend the Ganga Aarti at Har Ki Pauri in the evening — arrive early (by 5:30 PM) to get a good spot and experience the soulful atmosphere. Be cautious around the ghats; the river current is strong, so avoid swimming unless guided. Opt for registered e-rickshaws or autos to travel around the city affordably. Carry cash, as smaller shops and local eateries may not accept cards. If visiting Mansa Devi or Chandi Devi, consider buying a ropeway combo ticket to save time and effort. Also, avoid non-vegetarian food and alcohol during your stay — Haridwar is a devout vegetarian city. Finally, be respectful of local customs, don’t photograph people during rituals without permission, and keep the ghats clean.",

These drops made the city spiritually charged and gave rise to the Kumbh Mela, which occurs every 12 years.

      "essential": "Kunjapuri Devi Temple, located on a hilltop near Rishikesh, is a sacred Shaktipeeth that requires a climb of around 80 steps or a trek through forest trails. Visitors should be prepared for steep paths and high altitude, making comfortable shoes and water important. Photography is generally allowed, but respectful behavior and modest clothing are expected at this holy site. Littering, smoking, and loud behavior are not permitted. Aarti rituals are held daily, and the temple becomes especially crowded during festivals like Navratri and Dussehra. Many visitors arrive early in the morning to witness the peaceful and scenic sunrise.",
      "story": "One of the 52 Shakti Peethas, this temple is dedicated to Goddess Durga and is believed to be where her upper body fell during the legend of Sati. Kunjapuri has been a pilgrimage site for centuries and is also a key point in the spiritual triangle with Surkanda Devi and Chandrabadni temples.",
