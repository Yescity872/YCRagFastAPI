Dress modestly and respectfully, as most places are active temples or sacred ghats. Attend the Ganga Aarti at Har Ki Pauri in the evening — arrive early (by 5:30 PM) to get a good spot and experience the soulful atmosphere. Be cautious around the ghats; the river current is strong, so avoid swimming unless guided. Opt for registered e-rickshaws or autos to travel around the city affordably. Carry cash, as smaller shops and local eateries may not accept cards. If visiting Mansa Devi or Chandi Devi, consider buying a ropeway combo ticket to save time and effort. Also, avoid non-vegetarian food and alcohol during your stay — Haridwar is a devout vegetarian city. Finally, be respectful of local customs, don’t photograph people during rituals without permission, and keep the ghats clean.",

These drops made the city spiritually charged and gave rise to the Kumbh Mela, which occurs every 12 years. Haridwar has been a gateway to the Char Dham Yatra (Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, Badrinath) for centuries.",

To save the universe, Shiva drank the poison, which turned his throat blue, earning him the name “Neelkanth” (the blue-throated one).
