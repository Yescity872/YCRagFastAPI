            "cityHistory": "Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature, who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote : “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together” The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth. Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth.The city is a center of learning and civilization for over 3000 years. Ganges is said to have its origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi, it expands to the mighty river that we know of. With Sarnath, the place where Buddha preached his first sermon after enlightenment, just 10 km away, Varanasi has been a symbol of Hindu renaissance. Knowledge, philosophy, culture, devotion to Gods, Indian arts and crafts have all flourished here for centuries. Also a pilgrimage place for Jains, Varanasi is believed to be the birthplace of Parsvanath, the twenty-third Tirthankar. Vaishnavism and Shaivism have co-existed in Varanasi harmoniously. Varanasi has also been a great center of learning for ages. Varanasi is associated with promotion of spiritualism, mysticism, Sanskrit, yoga and Hindi language and honored authors such as the ever-famous novelist Prem Chand and Tulsi Das, the famous saint-poet who wrote Ram Charit Manas. Aptly called as the cultural capital of India, Varanasi has provided the right platform for all cultural activities to flourish. Many exponents of dance and music have come from Varanasi. Ravi Shankar, the internationally renowned Sitar maestro and Ustad Bismillah Khan, (the famous Shehnai player) are all sons of the blessed city or have lived here for major part of their lives. With a number of temples, Mrs. Annie Besant chose Varanasi as the home for her ‘Theosophical Society’ and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, to institute ‘Benares Hindu University, the biggest University in Asia. Ayurveda is said to be originated at Varanasi and is believed to be the basis of modern medical sciences such as Plastic surgery, Cataract and Calculus operations. Maharshi Patanjali, the preceptor of Ayurveda and Yoga, was also affiliated with Varanasi, the holy city. Varanasi is also famous for its trade and commerce, especially for the finest silks and gold and silver brocades, since the early days.",

The temple has a long and turbulent history—originally built in ancient times, it was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times by various rulers. The current structure was reconstructed in 1780 by Ahilyabai Holkar, the Maratha queen of Indore. The temple’s gold-plated spires and sanctum sanctorum radiate spiritual energy, drawing millions of pilgrims each year who believe that worshipping here grants moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth). Surrounded by narrow alleys of Varanasi and immersed in the sound of bells and chants, Kashi Vishwanath stands as a timeless symbol of faith, resilience, and divine presence.",

            "story": "The Baba Kal Bhairav Temple in Varanasi is one of the city's oldest and most fearsome shrines, deeply rooted in Hindu mythology and Shaivite traditions. The legend behind the temple begins when Lord Shiva, angered by Brahma's arrogance, created Kal Bhairav, a fierce form of himself, to punish Brahma. Kal Bhairav severed one of Brahma’s five heads, committing the grave sin of Brahmahatya (killing a Brahmin). Cursed, he was forced to wander with Brahma’s skull (kapala) stuck to his hand as a begging bowl. It was only when he entered Kashi (Varanasi) that the curse broke—the skull fell from his hand, and his sin was absolved. This sacred event established Varanasi as a land beyond sin, and Shiva appointed Kal Bhairav as the eternal guardian (Kotwal) of the city. Since then, it is believed that even death cannot enter Kashi without Kal Bhairav's permission, and every resident or visitor must seek his blessing to safely stay in the holy city. The temple has stood as a powerful symbol of protection, justice, and divine authority for centuries, visited by saints, kings, and devotees alike.",

            "story": "Sarnath, located about 10 km from Varanasi, is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in the world. It is the place where Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon after attaining enlightenment in Bodh Gaya around 528 BCE. This event, known as Dharmachakra Pravartan (Turning of the Wheel of Dharma), marked the beginning of the Buddhist Sangha (monastic community). At Sarnath, Buddha preached to his first five disciples, laying the foundation of his teachings—the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Over time, Sarnath grew into a major center of Buddhist learning, supported by Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, who erected a massive stone pillar with his edict and built several stupas and monasteries. The Dhamek Stupa, still standing today, marks the exact spot of the first sermon. Sarnath flourished for centuries until it was destroyed by invaders in the 12th century. Rediscovered in the 19th century through archaeological excavations, Sarnath is now a serene pilgrimage site and a symbol of peace, enlightenment, and the global spread of Buddhism.",

            "story": "The Annapurna Devi Temple, located near the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi, is dedicated to Goddess Annapurna, the Hindu goddess of food and nourishment, and an incarnation of Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva. The temple’s origins are deeply rooted in a powerful legend: according to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva once declared that the world is an illusion and that food is unimportant. To teach him the value of nourishment, Goddess Parvati appeared as Annapurna and disappeared, causing the entire world to suffer from hunger. Realizing his mistake, Shiva begged for food, and Parvati fed him with her own hands. This act not only humbled Shiva but also established food as a sacred gift. The temple was later reconstructed in its current form by Maratha queen Ahilyabai Holkar in the 18th century, who also rebuilt several temples in Varanasi including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. The main idol of Goddess Annapurna is made of gold, and once a year, during Annkoot (a day after Diwali), the idol is opened for darshan and a grand feast is offered to devotees. The temple is a vital part of Varanasi’s spiritual landscape, reminding all that feeding the hungry is one of the highest forms of worship. It continues to draw pilgrims, especially those who seek prosperity, nourishment, and spiritual satisfaction.",

It holds deep significance in pilgrimage routes, as it is considered the starting point for many spiritual journeys through Kashi.

According to Hindu mythology, it was at this sacred site that Lord Brahma performed a grand Ashwamedh Yajna (horse sacrifice) involving ten horses to welcome Lord Shiva to the earthly realm—hence the name \"Dashashwamedh\", meaning “Ten Horse Sacrifice.” Another version of the legend states that Lord Brahma created the ghat himself to perform rituals and establish Kashi as a divine city. Historically, the ghat has been a center of Vedic rituals and pilgrimage for centuries. The current structure was rebuilt in the 18th century by the Maratha rulers, notably Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao in 1748, and later improved by Ahilyabai Holkar. Dashashwamedh Ghat has since remained the heart of religious activity in Varanasi, especially known for its vibrant Ganga Aarti, which continues the ancient tradition of daily worship to the sacred river.",

            "story": "Manikarnika Ghat is one of the oldest and most sacred cremation ghats in Varanasi, known as the gateway to moksha (liberation). According to ancient Hindu legend, Lord Vishnu performed intense penance here to please Lord Shiva. Pleased with his devotion, Shiva granted the land of Kashi as an eternal sacred city. During this divine episode, Vishnu dug a well with his discus, and while bathing, Shiva’s earring (Manikarnika) fell into it—hence the name Manikarnika, meaning \"jeweled earring.\" This well, known as the Manikarnika Kund, still exists near the ghat and is considered highly auspicious. It is believed that cremation at Manikarnika Ghat ensures liberation from the cycle of rebirth. According to mythology, Maa Parvati asked Lord Shiva to ensure that devotees dying in Kashi achieve moksha, so Shiva whispers the Taraka mantra into the ears of the dying at this ghat. Historically, the ghat has been continuously active for thousands of years, and it remains the eternal flame cremation site, where funeral pyres burn 24/7 without pause.",

The ghat is home to the Tulsi Manas Temple and the Lolark Kund, a sacred pond where devotees bathe to seek blessings for children and health. Historically, the ghat was rebuilt in the 19th century by a devotee named Baldeo Das Birla.

At a time when India was under British colonial rule, Malaviya sought to empower the nation through education rooted in Indian values, culture, and self-reliance. With the support of Indian rulers like the Maharaja of Darbhanga and the Maharaja of Banaras, and significant public funding, BHU was founded in 1916 through the passage of the BHU Act in the Indian Legislative Council. The university became a hub for the Indian independence movement, with many of its students and professors participating in nationalist activities. It was also among the first institutions to promote education in Sanskrit, Ayurveda, Indian philosophy, and sciences side by side. The campus, spread across vast land donated by the Kashi royal family, became a model of integrated learning, symbolizing India’s intellectual and spiritual resurgence.",

Today, the fort houses the Ramnagar Fort Museum, showcasing an impressive collection of royal artifacts, vintage cars, and weapons.

The fort's origins date back to ancient times, with the earliest known references to the structure appearing in Mauryan period inscriptions. However, its most significant history unfolded during the medieval period when it was a key stronghold in the region's defense. The fort was initially built by Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty, although it was later expanded and fortified by various rulers. In the 16th century, Sher Shah Suri, the founder of the Suri Empire, made substantial improvements to the fort, fortifying it and using it as a stronghold in his struggle against the Mughal Empire. The fort’s strategic position on the Ganga allowed it to control the trade route, and over time, it became an important military base for various rulers, including the Mughals and the British. During the British colonial period, Chunar Fort was used as a prison for Indian freedom fighters, adding another layer to its historical significance. The fort, though in ruins today, is still an impressive structure with large walls, a moat, and numerous gates, offering insight into the fortification techniques of its time. It continues to be a site of historical interest for tourists and researchers.",

When Yamraj, the god of death, came to claim his soul, Markandeya clung to the Shiva Lingam. Yamraj threw his noose, which mistakenly landed around the Lingam too—an act that angered Shiva. Emerging in fury, Lord Shiva struck down Yamraj and granted Markandeya eternal life, declaring that true devotion could even conquer death. It is believed that this powerful event took place at the site where the Markandeshwar Mahadev Temple now stands. The temple, though modest in appearance, is revered for its spiritual energy and is especially visited by devotees seeking long life, protection from premature death, and spiritual strength. The surrounding area is peaceful, making it ideal for meditation and quiet worship.",

            "story": "The Nepali Temple in Varanasi, locally called the Shivala Ghat Temple or Mini Khajuraho, is a stunning 19th-century shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva, located at Lalita Ghat near the Ganga River. Its history is tied to the King of Nepal, Rana Bahadur Shah, who was exiled to Varanasi in the early 1800s after political conflict in his kingdom. Deeply devoted to Lord Shiva, he decided to build a replica of Kathmandu’s famous Pashupatinath Temple in Kashi. Though Rana Bahadur Shah died before the temple was completed, his son Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah ensured the temple’s completion around 1843. The temple was constructed using traditional Nepali architecture, with wooden carvings, terracotta tiles, and a pagoda-style design, distinct from North Indian temple styles. What makes the temple especially unique is its intricate woodwork and erotic sculptures, earning it the nickname Mini Khajuraho. Set in a peaceful corner of Varanasi, the Nepali Temple stands as a symbol of spiritual unity between India and Nepal, and is a beautiful reminder of Varanasi’s long-standing cultural connections with the Himalayan region.",

Established by Surat Gopal, one of Kabir's immediate disciples, this Math serves as a memorial to the saint's profound influence on the Bhakti movement and his emphasis on a formless, universal God. The term \"Chaura\" is derived from \"Chauraha,\" meaning a four-way crossing, signifying the Math's role as a crossroads of spiritual thought and practice. Kabir's teachings, which transcended religious boundaries, are encapsulated in texts like the Bijak, and the Math has been instrumental in promoting these philosophies across regions like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. The Math not only houses relics and manuscripts associated with Kabir but also serves as a hub for followers of the Kabir Panth, a sect that emerged from his teachings. Over the centuries, Kabir Math has remained a beacon of spiritual learning, attracting devotees and scholars alike who seek to understand and live by Kabir's message of love, equality, and devotion.",

            "story": "Bharat Mata Temple in Varanasi is a unique and deeply patriotic shrine, unlike any other in India, as it is dedicated not to a deity from mythology but to Bharat Mata, or Mother India, symbolizing the soul, culture, and unity of the nation itself. Established in 1936 by Babu Shiv Prasad Gupta, a nationalist and philanthropist, and inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi himself, this temple emerged during the freedom struggle as a sacred space representing India not just as a landmass but as a living embodiment of its people, heritage, and spiritual legacy. The temple houses no idol of a god or goddess but instead features a large, intricately carved relief map of undivided India, made in marble, depicting the mountains, rivers, and land of the country in stunning topographical detail. This symbolic representation was meant to inspire national pride, unity, and a spiritual connection to the motherland among Indians during the turbulent pre-independence era. It was designed to foster a sense of unity beyond religion, caste, or region—placing the nation itself as the object of reverence. Situated within the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith campus, the temple is a rare architectural and ideological marvel that merges spiritual devotion with national identity. The elevation lines and geological accuracy of the map are not just artistic but symbolic—reminding every visitor of the sacred geography of the land and the importance of its protection and unity. Unlike traditional temples that host rituals and daily aarti, Bharat Mata Temple is a silent place of reflection, where visitors are encouraged to contemplate their role in serving the nation. It also reflects the larger philosophy of India’s freedom movement, which viewed the country not as a political entity alone but as a divine mother whose cultural and spiritual greatness must be preserved. In a city known for its countless temples to gods and goddesses, Bharat Mata Temple stands apart as a temple to the spirit of India itself, where devotion is measured not in offerings but in love, service, and loyalty to the motherland.",

It is said that visiting or even remembering Pita Maheshwar grants liberation (moksha), as it represents the cosmic root from which the divine energy of Kashi emerges. While the shrine is not easily accessible to the public, the deep spiritual belief attached to it draws seekers, especially those on a path of inner awakening and liberation.",
            "essential": "Pita Maheshwar is not a typical public temple; it lies underground and is generally not open for regular darshan. Only a few are granted access with special permission. Visitors are advised to respect its spiritual secrecy and sanctity. No entry fee is charged, and strict decorum is expected. Photography, loud behavior, and unclean conduct are strictly prohibited. As with all sacred spaces in Kashi, leather items, alcohol, and non-vegetarian food are not allowed. The site is revered more through remembrance and faith than through physical visitation.",
            "story": "Pita Maheshwar is one of the most hidden and metaphysically powerful forms of Lord Shiva in Varanasi. The name means the “base or foundation of Maheshwar (Shiva)”, and it represents the invisible spiritual support of the entire city of Kashi. Mentioned in the Kashi Khand, it is said to lie deep beneath the earth, not easily accessible, and not visible to ordinary devotees. Instead of being worshipped through rituals, Pita Maheshwar is honored through remembrance, meditation, and surrender. Even Lord Vishwanath, the ruling deity of Kashi, is said to draw power from Pita Maheshwar. Saints and yogis have meditated upon this form to attain moksha (liberation). Its mysterious nature enhances its reverence, reminding seekers that the greatest spiritual truths lie beyond what can be seen or touched, in the eternal silence beneath",

But she refused to break the bond from her end, instead, asked him to do so from his end. So the son decided to come to the holy city of Kashi and built Lord Shiva's temple and that's how he tried to clear the debt of love. As the story goes, after the construction his mother cursed the temple stating that nothing can pay off a mother's love for her child. And since then the temple was damned and remains submerged in water.According to another story, it is believed that the temple was built by a female servant of Ahilya Bai of Indore, named Ratna Bai. Ahilya Bai cursed it to lean because her servant had named it after herself.The temple is elegantly constructed in the classical style of architecture with a nagara shikhara and phamsana mandapa.",

This event is called the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta — “Turning the Wheel of Dharma.” After attaining enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, Gautama Buddha traveled to Sarnath (then called Isipatana) in search of the five ascetics (his former companions). Sarnath thus became the birthplace of organized Buddhism.In the 3rd century BCE, Emperor Ashoka visited Sarnath and contributed significantly to its development by constructing the Dhamek Stupa and the Ashokan Pillar, both bearing inscriptions that promoted non-violence and dharma. Between the 5th and 12th centuries CE, Sarnath flourished as a major center of learning, filled with temples and monasteries that attracted scholars and monks from across Asia. However, in the 12th century, the site suffered destruction during the Turkish invasions. It remained in ruins until it was rediscovered by the British in the 19th century, sparking archaeological interest and preservation efforts.",

It was built in a commanding position, high above a meander in the Ganges River, near the Kaimur Hills. The approach to Chunar Hill is marked by a chain of low hills, running parallel to the river on its right bank, which is covered by plantations and bungalows.",
            "essential": "Wear steardy  shoes;take basic food supplies;refrain from alcohol",
            "story": "There are many legends linking the fort to divine aspects. One such is the story of King Bali. God, known in these parts as Bawan Bhagwan, appeared before Bali, disguised as a Brahmin, and begged for three feet of land. The generous king agreed. God placed his first step on the hill of Chunar Fort and left his foot mark there. Since then it is known as \"Charanadri\", which over the years took the short form of \"Chunar\".The second legend is king Vikramāditya of Ujjain. His brother Bharthari, who opted to live the life of a hermit, started living near the rockface of Chunar. Realising his brother's situation, Vikramadiathya visited Chunar, and after finding out his brother's whereabouts through the hermit Goraknath, built a house for his brother to live in. The black stone where the saint Bhatinath lived and prayed is worshiped even now, as it is believed that Bhatinath is seated in the fort area in an invisible form.A third legend linked the fort to the well known king of Rajasthan. Prithviraj brought this settlement under his rule and also many neighbouring villages. Subsequent to his demise, his descendants sold the land to Khair-ud-din Subuktagin. An inscription (not very legible) in Sanskrit on the gateway of the fort mentions that the place had been taken over by Swami Raja, who had established a stone tablet recording the event. Later, the fort was acquired by Sahab-ud-din.",

The only existing Valmiki Ashram on the banks of the river Ganges is located here .Once the place was visited by Swami Jitendranand Tirth and he had desired that a very magnificent memorial to Sitaji be built here. The Sita Samahit temple stands exactly on the mound where Bhagwati Sitaji descended into Mother Earth. This was built with the kind help of Late Shri. Satya Narain Prakash Punj, New Delhi who was inspired by his mother. Within the campus of the main temple there exists temples of Maa Sita & Lord Shiva. There also stands 108 ft. high statue of Ram Bhakt Hanuman installed on an artificial rock of 20 ft. Under this hillock there is a cave having small temple of Hanumanji",

            "story": "Shivdwar, also known as Uma Maheshwar Temple, is a Shaktipeeth (a place of Shakti worship) located in Sonbhadra district, Uttar Pradesh, dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. It is unique because it houses an idol of Shiva and Parvati, where water is offered to the deities rather than the traditional lingam. The templeis a significant pilgrimage site, particularly during the month of Shravan.It is believed that in the fourth decade of the 19th century, while plowing the fields, a village farmer named Moti Mahato found the unique statue of the famous Umamaheshwar in Satdwari village. When the idol was found, everyone considered it a blessing from God. Then this idol was installed by Avinash Kuwari, daughter-in-law of the village’s landlord family, and the temple was constructed. This temple was named Shivdwar.",
